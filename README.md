# GDPR Healthcare AI Compliance Scorer

## Overview

The **GDPR Healthcare AI Compliance Scorer** is a modular project designed to **assess AI systems for GDPR compliance**, specifically within healthcare contexts. It provides:

* **Evidence-based scoring** of textual inputs against GDPR requirements.
* **Reproducible test cases** using synthetic data.
* A framework that bridges **research experimentation** and **practical industry compliance verification**.

The project is open-source to encourage collaboration and ensure **full transparency and reproducibility**.

---

## Prerequisites

* **Git** for version control.
* **Bash** or a Unix-like shell for command execution.
* **Python 3.x** for later development of scoring models.
* Familiarity with **GDPR, healthcare data handling, and AI/ML concepts** is recommended.

**Rationale:** Ensures anyone replicating or extending the project can follow all steps reliably and understand why they are done.

---

## Project Setup

1. **Initialize repository**

```bash
git init
```

* Purpose: Establishes version control to track all changes and maintain reproducibility.

2. **Create directories**

```bash
mkdir test_docs
```

* Purpose: Organizes synthetic test documents separately from code for clarity and modularity.

---

## Synthetic Test Documents for Article 9

* **10 synthetic text documents** (`doc1.txt` – `doc10.txt`) created under `test_docs/`.
* **Content focus:** Simulated healthcare scenarios relevant to **Article 9: Processing of special categories of personal data**.

**Add files to Git:**

```bash
git add test_docs/*.txt
```

* Purpose: Stages files for commit; ensures all test documents are tracked.

**Commit changes:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add 10 synthetic test documents for Article 9 compliance scoring"
```

* Purpose: Creates a versioned snapshot of the project state.
* Rationale: Provides **baseline data** for reproducible research and model development.

**Push to GitHub:**

```bash
git push
```

* Purpose: Publishes changes to the remote repository.
* Rationale: Facilitates **collaboration** and **industry transparency**.

**Note:** Bash may display LF → CRLF warnings on Windows; these are normal and do not affect functionality.

## Rationale for This Approach

1. **Synthetic Data:** Ensures privacy while enabling realistic testing scenarios.
2. **Stepwise Versioning:** Each addition is committed individually to maintain **traceable history**.
3. **Bash Commands:** Using shell commands provides a **clear, reproducible setup** process.
4. **Research & Industry Ready:** All steps are documented so both researchers and practitioners can understand, reproduce, and extend the workflow.

---

## Next Steps

* Implement **scoring logic** for Article 9 compliance.
* Add modular packs for additional GDPR articles, EU AI Act, MDR, and anti-corruption checks.
* Expand README progressively as new functionality is added.
