Title: Hospital Information System Upgrade â€“ Data Integration Plan

Background:
The hospital plans to integrate patient data from multiple legacy systems into a unified electronic health record (EHR). This upgrade will improve efficiency and provide clinicians with faster access to relevant information. 

Data Processed:
The system will process personal identifiers (name, address, date of birth), health records (diagnoses, treatments, medications), and genetic test results where available. 

Data Handling:
All data will be encrypted in transit and at rest. Access will be restricted based on role, with audit logging of all access events. 

Consent & Legal Basis:
Patients are informed of data processing via hospital admission forms. Genetic and biometric data may be used for clinical decision-making and research, subject to existing national health laws. Consent is not requested separately for each research project. 

Safeguards:
The hospital will train staff in data protection practices and monitor system usage. Data may be shared with research partners under contractual agreements. 

Risks:
Some safeguards (e.g., explicit patient consent for secondary research) are not yet fully defined.
