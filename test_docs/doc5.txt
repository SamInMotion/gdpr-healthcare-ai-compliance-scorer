Title: Procurement of AI-Powered Diagnostic Equipment – Vendor Selection Report

Overview:
The hospital board is reviewing bids from multiple vendors to supply AI-powered diagnostic imaging equipment. The equipment will process sensitive health data, including biometric scans, to support clinical decision-making.

Data Processed:
Patient scans, demographic information, and diagnostic outcomes. No genetic data is directly collected. 

Data Handling:
Vendors are required to demonstrate GDPR compliance, but no independent audit of their claims has yet been conducted. Contracts mention encryption and secure storage, but details vary by vendor. 

Conflict of Interest Risks:
One vendor is partially owned by a hospital board member’s relative. This raises concerns of undue influence in the procurement process. Documentation of how conflicts of interest will be managed is missing. 

Ethical & Compliance Considerations:
The procurement committee has not established a transparent scoring system for vendor evaluation. Criteria such as price, security features, and accuracy are discussed informally, with no written weighting scheme. 

Conclusion:
While the equipment offers potential clinical benefits, the current process lacks both strong data protection guarantees and safeguards against corruption risks.
