Title: Proposal for AI-Based Recruitment Screening System

Overview:
This system aims to automate the initial screening of job applicants using natural language processing and machine learning. Candidates will upload CVs, which will be analyzed for skills, experience, and cultural fit. 

Data Processed:
The system will process personal data, including names, employment history, education, and professional skills. It may also collect optional demographic details such as gender and ethnic origin for diversity analytics. 

Data Use:
Recruiters will use the tool to create shortlists of candidates. Reports may include aggregated statistics about applicant pools. 

Data Protection:
Data will be stored on a third-party cloud provider. Candidates are informed that their data may be processed automatically. No explicit consent mechanism is built in for sensitive demographic attributes. Data may be retained for up to five years for future recruitment campaigns. 

Ethical Notes:
The project team acknowledges potential risks of bias but has not yet defined mitigation strategies.
