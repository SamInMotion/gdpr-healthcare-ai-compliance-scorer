Title: Procurement Integrity Report – Hospital Imaging System Upgrade

Summary:
This document describes the procurement process for upgrading the hospital’s radiology imaging system. Several vendors submitted proposals, and the final award was made to a supplier with prior contractual relationships to hospital leadership.

Data Considerations:
Vendor proposals included technical specifications and some personal data of staff who would be trained on the new system (e.g., names, roles, professional qualifications). No genetic, biometric, or health records of patients are part of this process.

Risk Factors:
Concerns were raised that selection criteria favored a single vendor. While procurement documentation states that evaluation was “objective,” there are no records of independent oversight. Additionally, one of the decision committee members had undisclosed financial ties to the awarded supplier.

Safeguards:
The hospital compliance office has proposed mandatory disclosure of conflicts of interest and anonymized scoring of vendor proposals. No such mechanisms were in place during this award cycle.

Conclusion:
The absence of transparency and safeguards against conflicts of interest poses risks to fair procurement practices. Future tenders must incorporate anti-corruption controls alongside data protection assurances for vendor staff information.
